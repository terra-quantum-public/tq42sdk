Unable to Execute: `{}`

We were unable to automatically detect the default org and/or proj ID required to run this command.
Please set an org and proj yourself by running the following commands:

`tq42 org set <ORG_ID>`
`tq42 proj set <PROJ_ID>`

These IDs can be either found on terraquantum.io or via the corresponding CLI commands `tq42 org list` / `tq42 proj list`.
For a list of available commands, type `tq42 --help` or consult the documentation at tq42.com/help.
