# Preparing Your Data and Hyper Parameters

The way you construct your code may differ depending on the type of algorithm or problem being solved. Visit [TQ42 Help](https://docs.tq42.com/en/latest/) for links to detailed documentation on each algorithm, including:

- An overview of the algorithm

- Code samples (including how to formulate the objective function and hyper parameters)

- Data samples

- Example applications 

For example, see helpful [documentation on TetraOpt](https://docs.tq42.com/en/latest/TetraOpt_Algorithm/Introduction.html#) - a global optimization library based on tensor train (TT) decomposition.
