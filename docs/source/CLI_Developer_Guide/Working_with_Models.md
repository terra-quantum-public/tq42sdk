# Working with Models

## Get information about models

After an experiment run created a model, these models are available to query by the user.

You can do one of two things to get the information about a model:

1. You can list all of your models in a given project by running 

```bash
tq42 proj model list --proj="PROJECT_ID"
```

2. Get information about a specific model by running

```bash
tq42 proj model get <MODEL-ID>
```
