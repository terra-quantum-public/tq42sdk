# Introduction to TQ42
The [TQ42 Python SDK](https://github.com/terra-quantum-public/tq42sdk) puts the power in your hands to accelerate delivery of custom, high-impact solutions. After installing the SDK and authenticating, access algorithms such as:

- **TetraOpt** – a global optimization library based on tensor train (TT) decomposition.
- **ClearVu Analytics (CVA)** – build predictive models for data driven insights, automated ML and optimization.
- **Quantum Encoding (QuEnc)** – a gradient-based optimization algorithm tailored for hardware-efficient quantum circuits utilizing amplitude encoding. 
- **TQnet** – train and apply custom, sequential hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with our comprehensive library.

With TQ42, there is no need to build or manage your own quantum circuits. Let our algorithms do the work. From the CLI, your Python IDE, or a Jupyter notebook:

- Set up your environment to work in the correct organization, project, and experiment
- Connect a dataset, if needed, or use communication channels
- Specify your objective function, hyperparameters, and compute infrastructure
- Run and manage experiments
- Visualize results

Collaborate with your teams across organizations and projects, and visit the [TQ42 web interface](https://terraquantum.io) for web-based tools to help you manage your account, projects, and experiments.
